    <h1>BRIAN KIPKURUI</h1>
    <p> I am a Geomatics and Geospatial Engineering student at Jomo kenyatta University of Agricuture and Technology</p>
    <p>I am passionate about using remote sensing and geospatial analysis techniques to study and manage water resources. My current project focuses on the spatial-temporal analysis of the effectiveness of the GRACE satellite in monitoring groundwater storage in medium-scale basins. By combining satellite data with groundwater measurements, I aim to provide valuable insights for sustainable water resource management and decision-making in these regions.</p>
